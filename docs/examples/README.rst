Examples
========

* `quickstart.ipynb <quickstart.ipynb>`_ shows examples of forward
  simulation and backward differentiation.
* `adjoint.ipynb <adjoint.ipynb>`_ demonstrates the reproducibility,
  the reversibility, and a toy optimization problem of the model.
* `png_example.ipynb <png_example.ipynb>`_ showcases @tsfloss's 
  implementation of forward simulations with Local-type Primordial
  Non-Gaussianity and bispectrum computations using JAX on a GPU.
  See `BFast <github.com/tsfloss/BFast>`_ for details.
* `png_equilateral_example.ipynb <png_equilateral_example.ipynb>`_ 
  demonstrates forward simulations with Equilateral-type Primordial 
  Non-Gaussianity and implements power spectrum and bispectrum 
  measurements using the 
  `PBI4 repository <https://github.com/matteobiagetti/pbi4/tree/main>`_.

Jupyter notebooks can be played as slides with `RISE
<https://rise.readthedocs.io>`_.
